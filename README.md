# MPMRecNet - Recurrence Risk Prediction for Colorectal Cancer

## Overview

**MPMRecNet** is a deep learning model designed to predict recurrence risk in stage I–III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using multiphoton microscopy (MPM) images. It combines two imaging modalities—TPEF and SHG—to extract structural and cellular features from unstained tissue, using MaxViT encoders and cross-modal attention fusion.

## Key Features

- Dual-modality MPM input (TPEF + SHG)
- MaxViT-based deep learning with attention pooling
- Focal Loss for class imbalance
- External validation AUC = **0.849**
- Nomogram integration with clinical features

## Environment

- Python 3.12 + PyTorch 2.5.1
- Mixed precision training (AMP)
- Key libraries: `torch`, `transformers`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`
